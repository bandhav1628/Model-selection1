# Model Selection for Agricultural Market Price Prediction

## 1. If Your Data is a Time Series (e.g., daily/weekly/monthly prices)

- **ARIMA/SARIMA**  
  Good for univariate time series data (only prices over time).

- **Prophet (by Facebook)**  
  Handles seasonality, holidays, and trend changes well. Works with missing data.

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks)**  
  Excellent for capturing complex patterns in sequential data. Useful if you have long sequences and multiple features (e.g., price, weather, yield).

## 2. If You Have Tabular Data (multiple features per record)

- **Linear Regression/Polynomial Regression**  
  Simple, interpretable. Good as a baseline.

- **Random Forest Regression**  
  Handles non-linear relationships and feature interactions. Robust to outliers.

- **Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**  
  Powerful for tabular data with many features (weather, yield, policy events...). Often yields state-of-the-art results.

## 3. If You Want to Use Deep Learning

- **LSTM, GRU, or 1D-CNN**  
  For time series with multiple features and longer historical context.

- **Hybrid Models**  
  Combine LSTM/GRU for time series + dense layers for tabular features.

## Recommendation

- **Start with ARIMA/Prophet** if your dataset is primarily time series (just prices over time).
- **Try Random Forest/XGBoost** if you have multiple features (prices, weather, yields, etc.).
- **Use LSTM** if you want to explore deep learning and have enough data (usually >1,000 records).

## Model Selection Factors

- **Amount of Data:** Deep learning (LSTM) requires more data than classical models.
- **Feature Set:** More features = prefer tree-based models or deep learning.
- **Interpretability:** Linear regression and tree-based models are easier to explain than deep learning models.
- **Seasonality:** Prophet is great for seasonal trends.

## Example Pipeline

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Plot trends, check seasonality.
2. **Baseline Model**: Linear regression or ARIMA.
3. **Advanced Model**: Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTM/Prophet.
4. **Model Comparison**: Measure using MAE, RMSE, MAPE.
